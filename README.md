# Phi Lambda Phi National Fraternity
## Website Repository

Any brothers who are interested in helping out with the website are welcome to mess with this repository. Let me (blaine, bhar2254) know if you do and I'll update the repository to the live version (currently hosted by a private repo on my account) and start hosting the site from this repository instead.
